### Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?
- Desicion Tree Classifier
- Na√Øve Bayes Classifer 

### How accurate is your solution of prediction?
- Precision for "No" class: 0.91 (91%)
- Precision for "Yes" class: 0.28 (28%)s

- Recall for "No" class: 0.83 (83%)
- Recall for "Yes" class: 0.44 (44%)

- F1-score for "No" class: 0.86
- F1-score for "Yes" class: 0.34

- Support for "No" class: 255
- Support for "Yes" class: 39

The overall accuracy of the model is 0.78 (78%), which means that approximately 78% of the predictions made by the model are correct.


### Which were the challenges in the project development?
 
 
 
 ## App environment setup

### Start virtual environment on Mac/Linux, you must be in the terminal inside the project folder (e.g., vscode terminal):

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

### activate the environment:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### deactivate the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### for Windows:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### start the environment:

```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### deactivate the environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

### thereafter you write:
