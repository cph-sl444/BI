Your task is to use the data for training a regression model that can be used for
prediction of prices of properties not listed in the file.

- What type/s of regression have you applied?

Linear regession, specifically the LinarRegession class. The code trains a linear regression model using the trainingdata (x_train and y_train) and uses it to predict the target variable (y_pred) for the testdata (x_test). 

- Which were the challenges?

Deciding with features to include in the model
Checking the quality of the data (missing values, outliers ect.)

- How accurate is your solution?
 

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?

More features could be included in the model to  se if diffrent features and the prices is pridictable in the future.
